# The Blog Project

Showcasing a complete and functional project demonstrates what I can bring to your project. I built The Blog Project from the ground up to demonstrate my skill in front end, back end, security and database development. This is a Full Stack Web Development project, built so you can demo it easily. Contact me for a complete code walkthrough.
